	<h3>About Lab25</h3>
	
	<p class='text'>Lab25 is an innovative research center specializing in Cognitive and Behavioral Science, housed within the School of Psychology at the National Autonomous University of MÃ©xico (UNAM) in Mexico City. Our interdisciplinary team combines experimental psychology, computational modeling, and behavioral analysis to understand decision-making processes across species.</p>
	
	<p class='text'>Our mission is to advance the understanding of how both human and non-human organisms adapt their behavior in response to environmental challenges and opportunities. We employ cutting-edge methodologies and theoretical frameworks to bridge the gap between behavioral observations and underlying cognitive mechanisms.</p>
	
	<p class='text'>Our research focuses on several key areas:</p>
	<div class="research-areas">
		<ul>
			<li class='ho' style="text-align:justify"><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Investigating how organisms learn from experience and feedback</li>
			<li class='ho' style="text-align:justify"><strong>Intertemporal Choice:</strong> Studying decision-making across different time horizons</li>
			<li class='ho' style="text-align:justify"><strong>Risky Choice:</strong> Examining how individuals evaluate and respond to uncertainty</li>
			<li class='ho' style="text-align:justify"><strong>Perceptual Decision Making:</strong> Understanding how sensory information guides choices</li>
			<li class='ho' style="text-align:justify"><strong>Timing:</strong> Exploring temporal perception and its role in behavior</li>
			<li class='ho' style="text-align:justify"><strong>Game Theory:</strong> Analyzing strategic decision-making in social contexts</li>
			<li class='ho' style="text-align:justify"><strong>Categorization:</strong> Investigating how organisms organize and classify information</li>
			<li class='ho' style="text-align:justify"><strong>Bayesian Modeling:</strong> Developing computational models of learning and decision-making</li>
		</ul>
