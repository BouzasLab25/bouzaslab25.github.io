 <h2>About</h2>
 
 <p class='text'> I am currently studying a masters in Economics at the UNAM. I am interested (regarding Psychology) in psychometrics, decision theory, behavioral game theory, stimulus equivalence, psychophysics and in general, topics related to learning. My interests -regarding Economics and up to this point in my formation- are economic history and behavioral economics. My thesis is about cooperation and commitment devices using sequential games. </p>
