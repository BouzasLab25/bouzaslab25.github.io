 <h2>About</h2>
 
 <p class='text'> PhD Candidate in Psychology at UNAM. My dissertation compares and contrasts different methods to assess intertemporal preferences (publication coming soon). 
 
 <p class='text'>This past spring I was a visiting scholar at the Dynamic Decision Making Laboratory from Carnegie Mellon University (<a class= 'link' href="https://www.cmu.edu/ddmlab" >www.cmu.edu/ddmlab</a>) in Pittsburgh, PA (go Penguins!). </p>

<p class='text'>I obtained my bachelor's degree in psychology from UNAM back in 2012. My thesis researched how young people assess positive and negative outcomes of drinking alcohol, via latent variables models. While I was working on that project, I got an associate degree in teaching English as a foreign language (EFL), also at UNAM.   </p>
 
 <h2>Research Interests</h2> 

   <p class='text'> My main interest within decision sciences is the study of intertemporal choice; my secondary interest is the assessment of risky behaviors (probability estimation of outcomes, commitment strategies, and so on). More broadly speaking, I am attracted to psychometrics, public policy, and adaptive decision making topics.  </p>
