 <h2>About</h2>
 
 <p class='text'> I am a PhD student in computer sciences and an undergraduate student in psychology. I am currently developing the navigation system for a service robot as part of my PhD thesis. My work at Lab25 is focused on the application of cognitive models to the development of mobile robots in areas such as task planning, knowledge representation, and reasoning. </p>
 
 <p class='text'>From my point of view, in the field of service robots, a greater level of autonomy can be achieved by applying cognitive psychology to the development of robotics software.  | Other fields of interest: neuroscience, cognitive sciences, artificial intelligence, control and automation.  </p>
